Item|Quantity
:--|--:
Beef Mince¹|500g²
Pork Mince¹|500g²
Onions|2
Celery|2 sticks
Beef Oxo³|2 cubes
Bovril⁴|2 tsp
Tomato Puree|2"
Garlic Puree|2"
Chopped Tinned Tomatoes|2 Tins
Oregano|some
Nutmeg|some

¹ You could cook this with just one type of mince. Either half the other ingredients or double the mince to compensate.

² I use 500g of each mince as I can't buy 250g of pork mince at my local supermarket. If you can, it might make sense to half all the other ingredients and cook less.

³ Oxo is a brand of stock cubes. One cube makes approx 200ml of stock.

⁴ Bovril is a brand of meat extract paste.

## Method
After adding any new ingredient to the pot, stir thoroughly.

0) Brown and break up the mince
0) Boil a kettle and make the beef stock
0) Add the onion and celery while the kettle boils
0) Once the onion is cooked, add the purees
0) Add beef stock⁵ and Bovril
0) Add oregano and nutmeg
0) Add the tinned tomatoes
0) Simmer until thickened

⁵ You could also add some beef gravy granules to the stock if you want it even beefier

## Notes
The sauce could take quite a while to thicken. Adding flour to the sauce before the stock can help; It will thicken faster, but the flavour may be affected.
