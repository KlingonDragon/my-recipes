Item|Quantity
:--|--:
Leeks|500g
Bacon|300g
Single Cream¹|300ml
Thyme|some

¹ I don't use cream; I use Elmlea; Elmlea is a cream alternative made with buttermilk and vegetable oil.

## Method
0) Fry bacon and leeks in a saucepan until leeks are soft
0) Add cream and thyme
0) Simmer until the sauce has thickened.

## Notes
There are no instructions here for cooking the spaghetti. I usually start boiling the kettle once the bacon and leeks are on.

My choice of spaghetti can be replaced with another shape of pasta.
