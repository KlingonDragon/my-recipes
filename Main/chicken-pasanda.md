## Ingredients
Item|Quantity
:--|--:
Chicken Strips|600g
Onion|1
Garlic Puree|2"
Ground Coriander|2 tsp
Ground Cumin|2 tsp
Ground Turmeric|2 tsb
Ground Cinnamon|2 tsb
Paprika|1 tsp
Chilli Powder|1 tsp
Salt|1 tsp
Sugar|1 tsp
Ground Almonds|100g
Desiccated Coconut|100g
Milk|200ml
Double Cream¹|300ml
Oil|for non-stick

¹ I don't use cream; I use Elmlea; Elmlea is a cream alternative made with buttermilk and vegetable oil.

## Method
I use two pans for this recipe; A frying pan and a large stock pot. This lets me start on the sauce while the chicken and onions cook. It could all be done in one pan so long as it's large enough and has enough flat area to fry the initial ingredients.

0) Add the Chicken and Onion to a frying pan; fry until the chicken is browned and the onions are soft.
    > The onion and chicken may cook at different rates, once each is complete, you can move it to the pot separately.
0) Add the garlic, coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, paprika, chilli powder, salt, and sugar to the pot, stirring well to combine.
0) Add the ground almonds and desiccated coconut to the pot and stir well to coat the chicken and onions.
0) Pour in the milk and cream.
0) Simmer until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened.

## Notes
The original recipe created by Chat GPT used slightly different ingredients. I made some changes for my tastes, to simplify the recipe, or to reduce food waste (e.g. I couldn't buy a small enough pot of yoghurt).
