¹ Completely optional but helps with the nutty taste

² I don't use cream; I use Elmlea; Elmlea is a cream alternative made with buttermilk and vegetable oil.

## Method
0) Fry the Chicken and Onion with butter until the chicken is browned and the onions are soft
0) Stir in the garlic, coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, paprika, chilli powder, salt, sugar, ground almonds, and desiccated coconut
0) Pour in the Amaretto, Malibu, milk, and cream
0) Simmer until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened

## Notes
The original recipe created by Chat GPT used slightly different ingredients. I made some changes for my tastes, to simplify the recipe, or to reduce food waste (e.g. I couldn't buy a small enough pot of yoghurt).
